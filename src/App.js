            Once, in a time not so long ago, Gerry walked the Earth as a human. He wasn't a tremendously brilliant human, and led, what could perhaps best be described as a ne'er-do-well existence. However, in the last few seconds of his life, a child darted into the path of an oncoming vehicle. In that instant, all the noise of Gerry's life muted, and there was only a single, clear and noble choice. He intervened, dived into the road and pushed the child to safety. Gerry was killed in the process. His soul, unburdened by the chance to second-guess, felt a profound sense of peace. He had, without question or regret, finally done something true.
        </p>
        <p className="intro-text">
            When Saint Peter met Gerry at the gates of Heaven, he couldn't, in good conscience, turn him away. Despite Gerry's prior existence, it wouldn't be proper to ignore his final act of self-sacrifice and bravery. So, Saint Peter offered Gerry a chance to earn his way to Heaven: by collaborating with Paul Timoney and sharing the strange and crooked wisdom he'd gathered from a life lived in the margins. And so, Archangel Gerry was born, continuing his mission to offer guidance and a weird, fresh perspective to all who seek it.
